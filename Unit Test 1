How to Use:
Ensure the required JAR files (javassist.jar and json.jar) are placed in the Documents directory.
Run the Python script.
The script will compile and run the Java program, start the GUI, and run unit tests concurrently.
Use the GUI to add, modify, remove, and scan mods. The results and conflicts will be displayed and saved as specified.
This setup ensures a robust way to manage and check for mod incompatibilities, combining the power of Java for bytecode analysis and Python for GUI and testing.
