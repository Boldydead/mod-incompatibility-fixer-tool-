Features
Mod Compatibility Analysis

. Analyzes mod code to identify potential conflicts.

. Checks for overlapping item IDs, conflicting recipes, and incom patible game mechanic

. Provides suggestions for resolving conflicts using integrated Al models.

Error Diagnosis and Troubleshooting

. Interprets error logs to identify the cause of problems.

. Suggests solutions, including changes to mod configuration files, different versions of
identifying incom patible mods.


Version Checking

. Checks the version compatibility of Minecraft, Forge, and the mods being used.

. Recommends compatible versions if a mod is not com patible with the current setup.


Automated Testing

. Automatically tests mods in a virtual Minecraft environment.

· Identifies issues, checks mod features, monitors performance, and detects crashes.

Community Knowledge Integration

. Integrates knowledge from Minecraft modding communities, forums, and wikis.

. Pulls in solutions to common problems, recommendations for mod combinations, and tips for
mod configuration.


Bytecode Analysis

. Extracts features from bytecode for detailed analysis.

. Constructs and analyzes control flow, data flow, and call graphs.

Built-in Code Fixer and Optimizer

. Automatically suggests and applies fixes to mod code.

· Optimizes performance based on provided data.


Installation
Prerequisites
. Python 3.8 or higher

· Docker

· Java Development Kit (JDK)

· Git

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github. com/Boldydead/ai-brain-minecraft-mod-management.git
cd  ModMasterAI

2. Create a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Setup Docker
Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system. You may need to install Docker from
Docker's official site.

5. Download Additional Resources
The project requires certain jar files for decompilation and other tasks. Ensure these are
downloaded as part of the setup process.


Usage
Running the Al Brain

1. Configure Mod Directory
Update the `mod_directory' variable in the "AIBrain' class to point to your Minecraft mods
directory.

2. Run the AI Brain
python ai_brain.py


Example Script
Here's an example script demonstrating the main functionalities:

import asyncio
import logging
from ai_brain import AIBrain

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
ai_brain = AIBrain(mod_directory=r"C:\Users\yourusername\curseforge\minecraft\Instances\Crazy Craft Updated\mods")

async def main():
    await ai_brain.run_tests()
    await ai_brain.process_mod_jar('path/to/sample.jar')
    mods = ai_brain.scan_mods()
    logging.info(f"Scanned mods: {mods}")
    ai_brain.update_mods(mods)
    dependencies_info = ai_brain.resolve_all_dependencies(mods)
    logging.info(f"Resolved dependencies: {dependencies_info}")
    performance_data = [
        {'function_name': 'function1', 'elapsed_time': 0.2, 'memory_used': 10.0},
        {'function_name': 'function2', 'elapsed_time': 1.2, 'memory_used': 50.0},
        {'function_name': 'function3', 'elapsed_time': 0.5, 'memory_used': 20.0},
    ]
    predictions = ai_brain.optimize(performance_data)
    suggestions = ai_brain.suggest_optimizations(predictions, threshold=0.8)
    for suggestion in suggestions:
        logging.info(suggestion)
    await ai_brain.test_mods_in_sandbox()
    compatibility_conflicts = await ai_brain.analyze_mod_compatibility(mods)
    logging.info(f"Compatibility conflicts: {compatibility_conflicts}")
    error_suggestions = await ai_brain.diagnose_and_suggest_fixes('path/to/error.log')
    logging.info(f"Error suggestions: {error_suggestions}")
    version_incompatibilities = ai_brain.check_version_compatibility(mods)
    logging.info(f"Version incompatibilities: {version_incompatibilities}")
    community_knowledge = await ai_brain.integrate_community_knowledge(mods)
    logging.info(f"Community knowledge: {community_knowledge}")
    await ai_brain.decompile_mod('path/to/input.jar', '1.16.5')
    await ai_brain.analyze_bytecode('path/to/bytecode.class')

asyncio.run(main())


Configuration

. Modify the `mod_directory' to point to your local Minecraft mods directory.

. Update any other configuration settings in the `AIBrain` class to match your setup.
